In the fall of 2012, driven from the overwhelming feeling that there needed to be a way to donate large items like couches and dinning room suites that was SIMPLE, the PickUpMyDonation.com idea was born.  The team at PickUpMyDonation.com created a cloud based platform that allows donors to get their pick up request to a participating non-profit in less than two minutes from a computer, tablet, or smart phone.  In an industry that has forever required the donor to call in, leave a message and wait for a return phone call, the PickUpMyDonation.com platform has created the perfect solution.  The national brand drives donation requests to participating non-profits from their own advertising efforts, but also offers a solution for any non-profit to offer the power of web based scheduling through a simple link on their website.   
In addition to donation options, there are also solutions for donors that have “Junk” removal needs or urgent pick up requests through our national partnerships with organizations like College Hunks Hauling junk and 1-800-Got- Junk.  Our goal has always been “to make the donation process as simple as possible for donors, while increasing tangible donations to non-profits who can resell the items to support great work in their own communities”.
 
Since PickUpMyDonation.com launched in the fall of 2012, the network has grown to over 160 pick up providers nationwide and over 5,000 donation requests each month. The live counter just turned $20,000,000 in total requests based on the average value per pick up from participating pick up providers. The PickUpMyDonation.com team excited to be a part of such a great solution for non-profits who provide a pick up service in their community, but more importantly, to play a small role in helping to fund the work being done by these great organizations.
 
The list of pick up providers includes independent stores from Society of St. Vincent De Paul, Habitat for Humanity, The Association of Gospel Rescue Missions, Disabled American Veterans, AmVets, and a host of other independent non-profits.
